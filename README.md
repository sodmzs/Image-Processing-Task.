"man_with_gun.png" is the main image. (recommended to use this image only for the better output.)
"guitar.png" is the musical instrument image.
"Temp" directory will store the image files for analyzing the steps of processing.
"config.ini" contains all the sensitive information of the project.

Note: Since the project is on the very initial phase, it's not dynamic yet for replacing the inpainted area of the masked image with the musical instrument photo accurately. 

This project contains APIs so connection of internet is required.
